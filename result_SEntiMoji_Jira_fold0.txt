The tricky thing with all the stacktraces we have as of now is that they don't seem to be the cause of the issue. Something is eating all the memory and as a consequence stuff starts to go wrong in arbitrary places. We need to find whatever is eating the memory in the first place. It might be very well be releated to the security provider. Can you try to run a memory profiler and see whether you can spot what is holding all the memory?	0	0

"bq. guess we need to supply a tool to rename sstables files if anyone is on longer names?  We probably don't need to do anything. I don't think anyone is really using names long enough for them to it the file system limit, the goal of limiting the names is just so to prevent this from happening but there will be no other assumption that the names are short from the code.  I also don't think anything will prevent rolling upgrades, do you had something in mind?  Note: I have a long flight ahead of me so I plan to update my last patch with both those changes, as I still like the moving of all the directories handling in a dedicated class, even if we don't support both layout."	0	0

"[~bikassaha] Thanks for the heads-up Bikas! This JIRA is not concerned with the Tez integration for Pig and is simply the abstraction in Pig to allow for alternate ExecutionEngines in Pig. But will certainly change this on the Tez integration side of stuff.  Thanks a lot [~cheolsoo] for continuing this! I think everything looks good from my end. I can certainly see why we may want to keep this on a different branch until everything is finalized. Certain things may still need more work. For example, OutputStats is not completed abstracted out, as it still has references to POStore which is a MR implementation construct. ScriptState/PPNL/JobStats may still need more abstraction (especially PPNL) and reworking to incorporate a new ExecutionEngine abstraction. I think what we have done here is the minimum foundation for an abstraction though, and it would be appropriate to put into trunk, but these are not my decisions to make.  With regard to public methods that were changed, I don't think most of them are a big deal, besides as Cheolsoo said, the PigServer throwing PigException. I never thought IOException was a good exception to throw, but I think reverting PigServer back to IOException as it is userfacing code is not a big deal. The rest of the method signature changes shouldn't be worrisome because most of them are internal to the project.  However, the change from JobStats to MRJobStats, while necessary (as each ExecutionEngine would have it's own type of JobStats it would present to the end user), could be problematic because it is userfacing code and would probably break people who were previously using JobStats. That I think is the most important thing to keep in mind. The task of making the PPNL and JobStats clearly tied to the ExecutionEngine should be thought through also."	1	1

"I think my first preference  would be to make this only a java 7 and up feature. The change is very clear and we can use our normal testing methods.  Meanwhile users can set their umask appropriately.  My second preference would be only  to only change permissions by default  with java 7 and higher. I think we really need to have tests for the default configuration and non-portable tests might have to be customized to different environments, which seems like a lot of effort for something that won't be used moving forward.  I am sorry I didn't chime in earlier.  Time has been quite tight recently. "	-1	-1

"Stefan   > the said method is not public since it returns *all* workspace names, regardless of user rights. please note that > the a session must only see/know about workspaces it is actually allowed to access.  I'm working on a garbage collector for the data store. The GC doesn't care about user rights, or, putting it another way, it must be able to access all workspaces. Ideally I'd like to use a SystemSession, but you can't get one outside RepositoryImpl or o.a.j.c package (i.e., getSystemSession(String) is package private, WorkspaceInfo is protected). I understand that these APIs shouldn't be public, but they're useful from within the core. In my case, for the GC.

What we really need is a way to remove NTLM headers after the authentication has succeeded.  Mike"	0	0

"It'd work but it's a halfway hack to the real fix we should do in 0.92.  My points is that I think it is a good idea in general to raise this timeout (while adding configs so you don't necessarily have to wait since smallish clusters could use the max param if they want to speed this up)... we have run into the situation where not all RS came in the 3 second window (which really is too small given heartbeat frequency) so I've already ramped up the config timeout for fb production.

"> Have checked in this change which can be reviewed here: http://fisheye6.atlassian.com/changelog/click/?cs=766349  > Would appreciate any feedback. I just have the feeling this entire ControlRegistry is growing over our heads. Taking a look at many older applications with older Click releases, I can't stop thinking that Click was very good for years without it. I also received a few custom components for maintenance and I don't think this change (nor ControlRegistry) is of any needed in them (or maybe simply I'm not getting the entire concept).  Of course, I'm a newbie, but my impression is that most of the advantages you list are for ClickClick. Is it possible that the problem is with the ClickClick  approach(and that should be changed), not with Click?  Many parts of Click are simple to understand and nice, but this one is not. Making it even more complex, is just a guarantee that users like me will understand it even less.  From what I saw, one of the most important parts of Click is backward compatibility. For this however, Click should remain very simple, otherwise it will get big and bloated(and it can't afford ""published"" experiments). Tapestry on the other and can do this since with every new version they throw aboard the entire compatibility, so ""experiments"" if go wrong are not that a problem - and history shows that complex things always go wrong sooner or later (latest one: with T5.2 they'll trow maven away now :) )  My wish is when I look at the Click source code to be able to quickly understand what's up there - cause only so I have a good feeling when I use it  in applications (otherwise I have that ""black box feeling"" - and it's not fun ). I think like this, are most users - those who prefer complex thing have a very huge choice of concurrent frameworks :). "	0	1

"Hi Fuhwei   I was a bit worried by the big override method in your patch, so I have taken a good long look at this, but as its an area of the code I'm not very familiar with I can't necessarily jump in with an expert comment.  My current analysis of this is that EMF forces an assumption in the two lines of XSDEcoreBuilder's createFeature method  XSDTypeDefinition elementTypeDefinition = getEffectiveTypeDefinition(xsdComponent, xsdElementDeclaration); EClassifier eClassifier = getEClassifier(elementTypeDefinition);  that the type of an element is contained in the emf representation generated from the input schema.  So, if we could override getEffectiveTypeDefinition and conditionally return an XSDTypeDefinition from the metadata available within our SDO scope then we would be OK.  For the case where the type referenced in the schema was provided by an earlier XSD to SDO conversion I think we can retrieve this data, and then do whatever's necessary, if anything, to get the EClassifier based on that type definition (I haven't spent the time to dig into that as I thought now was a good time to discuss)  This wouldn't cover the case where a schema writer was assuming some types were available that hadn't been produced from an XSD,  but I don't know that that's currently a realistic use case.  If my analysis is correct we could lobby EMF to make a change so that the above two lines were incorporated into a single protected method call that didn't require the EClassifier lookup to proceed via an XSDTypeDefinition instance. Then our override would be able to return an EClassifier based on the xsdComponent and xsdElementDeclaration directly.  What do you think?  Have I missed a/the point here? "	0	0

hudson was hung just now for 7 hours in TestHRegion.  TestHRegion is unorthodox -- intentionally -- in that it doesn't use inherit from HBaseClusterTestCase so it didn't pick up the changes made w/ mhbc.patch.  Hopefully its this anomaly that was responsible for the hang.  Attaching a patch that has TestHRegion do like the rest of the hbase (and hadoop dfs) tests shutting down the filesystem first and then the dfs cluster.	0	0

planning to fix this.. I am planning to remember completed containers (only id) at node manager for predefined time (10min). Does that time sounds reasonable or we should make it configurable? ... I don't really think adding a new configuration parameter will be a good idea but I am open for any different approach / adding conf .. thoughts? This will have a similar implementation like YARN-62 but only difference is that YARN-62 only tracks container for a time after it starts to avoid duplicate launch..where as this tries to avoid logging errors for valid stop attempts...	0	0

"Hi Neil  Thanks for the advice ...  > On the other hand, if you can design a handler that knows how to > make appropriate calls to the scanner's sendChars() method so that > the buffer gets flushed when a maximum buffer size is reached, then > perhaps a pluggable handler wouldn't be necessary since the default > behaviour would always work when an application has chosen to set > this limit.  The code I have, as written, does have the pluggable handler notion, since I didn't want to arbitrarily couple the XMLBuffer class implementation (or worse, it's interface) to the scanner. I didn't go so overboard as to allow multiple registered handlers, or anything like that; this seemed simple enough without being a hack.  > I'd also observe that XMLBuffer has to check to use the > infelicitously named ""insureCapacity()"" method to make sure it's > large enough  Yes, this is where I implemented the full-handler invocation. It's more or less as you describe. Once I get everything cleaned up, I'll post the patch here; you'll probably find it to be entirely unsurprising.  I think what I'll end up doing to allow user-configurable buffer size limit will be to add a setter method on Parser and AbstractDOMParser, something like setInputBufferSize(). I think that would be most consistent with the existing API. Sound ok?"	0	1

"Vishal Kher to Benjamin  Camille  9:38 AM (54 minutes ago)  Hi Ben,  I was going to open a jira after checking with you guys.  With your solution won't we run in into the problem that Camille pointed out by marking the snapshot for lastZxid - 1? - Peer fails after taking the snapshot. The snapshot has applied lastZxid, which created a child znode. During recovery it will apply lastZxid, which will faill with NodeExists and we will increment the Cversion of the parent (after fix for ZOOKEEPER-1046). So creation of sequential znodes won't be be really sequential. This is probably acceptable, but should be clearly documented. If not, then from this bug, it looks to me that patch ZOOKEEPER-1046 was also not complete. We may need to conditionally update cversion.  I think we need a clear document of how snapshots are supposed to work and what to assume while taking snapshots and while recovering from snapshots. It will be very helpful for to verify the correctness of implementation and for future bug fixes.I will open a jira for this bug shortly and post our discussion as well.  Thanks.  -Vishal  "	0	1
