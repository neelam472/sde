"{quote} ...but even if we don't do that, i suppose it's also conceivable that someone might have their own Similarity implementation that is expensive to instantiate (ie: maintains some big in memory data structures?) and might want to be able to declare one instance and then refer to it by name in many different fieldType declarations. {quote}  I don't think this is really a use case we need to support: the purpose of Similarity today is to do term weighting, not to be a huge data-structure holder.  While I know Mike's original patch went this way with LUCENE-2392 (e.g. norms), I'm not sure i like it being in Similarity in the future either.  Otherwise concepts like lazy-loading norms and all this other stuff get pushed onto the sim, which is an awkward place (imagine if you have many fields).  So, I think we shouldn't really design for abuses of the API. If there are other use cases for ""named similarity"" that have to do with term weighting, I'm interested. "	0	0

In EditLogFileInputStream, why do we need to pass isInProgress as a boolean? If it's in-progress, that means we don't know the lastTxId, so it would be INVALID_TXID, right? So we can implement isInProgress() by just comparing lastTxId.  Because in the case of pre-transactional ELFIS, we pass in INVALID_TXID, even though the log is not yet in progress.

"{quote} I don't really know much about NamedSPILoader but I think what you're suggesting. How would we support Factories loading unrelated classes like they can through ResourceLoader now? Assume they're on the classpath and use Class.forName? {quote}  It needs more discussion (and input from Uwe would help!), but it works like Charset.forName(""ASCII"") etc. We use this already for codecs and postingsformats (Codec.forName, Codec.listAllCodecs, ...).  Have a look at lucene/core/src/resources/META-INF/services for the idea. Basically you ""register"" your classes in your jar file this way: additional jar files (e.g. look at lucene/test-framework/src/resources/META-INF) can load more classes.  So this could support some idea like TokenizerFactory.forName(""Whitespace"") or something simple like that. So someone would not need to use org.apache.solr.analysis.xxx namespace to be able to load their analyzer stuff easily, they use whatever package they want and register in their META_INF. And added jar files (other analysis jars), are automatically available this way.  I think Uwe mentioned this idea before, though I think he had Analyzers in mind (e.g. provide language code and get back analyzer or something). Anyway thats for another issue :)  Just something worth consideration if we want to make these modules really pluggable. On the other hand we shouldn't use anything overkill if its not the right fit... "	0	1

It also:  * Renames reopenLock to refreshLock * Shares the refresh logic between maybeRefresh and maybeRefreshBlocking. * Switches to use ReentrantLock instead of Semaphore(1): ** It allows to protectively obtain the lock in doMaybeRefresh (see comment in the code) ** It is better in general because it's equivalent to Semaphore(1), yet protects against an accidental bug where someone changes Semaphore(1) to Semaphore(>1).

I don't think there's any point in compliance with legacy if nobody depended on the behavior (they couldn't specify the behavior before either).  Just because its easy to set the include  doesn't mean the default is arbitrary.

"{quote} This wasn't a problem with my patch, right?  That was an issue of the mahout script in trunk itself? {quote}  Yes it was a problem with the script in trunk. I believe this was due to the fact that the job files were on the classpath instead of all of the dependency jars. Adding the job files to the classpath does not add the dependency jars they contain to the classpath as well. So, no you didn't add this, but it should be fixed (and is in the patch)  {quote} What is the -core option for?  I've never used it, how does it work? {quote}  when you're running bin/mahout in the context of a build the -core option is used to tell it to use the build classpath instead of the classpath used for a binary release. This just follows the pattern established (by Doug?) in the hadoop and nutch launch scripts.  {quote} Also added a help message for the 'run' argument. {quote}  near line 72 in bin/mahout: (this is different from the --help question I had)  {code} echo ""  seq2sparse            generate sparse vectors from a sequence file"" echo ""  vectordump            dump vectors from a sequence file"" echo ""  run                   run mahout tasks using the MahoutDriver, see: http://cwiki.apache.org/MAHOUT/mahoutdriver.html"" {code}  {quote} So you already added the ability to load via classpath, right? If we merge that way of thinking with what I'm currently working on (having a configurable ""MAHOUT_CONF_DIR"" which is used for all these props files), we could just have the mahout shell script just add MAHOUT_CONF_DIR to the classpath (the way you already have it adding the hardwired core/src/main/resources directory) and then it would work that way. {quote}  Yep, that should do it, as long as MAHOUT_CONF_DIR appears before src/main/resources, we should be good to go. It should be added outside of the section of the script that determines if -core has been specified on the command-line.  "	0	0

"Split out some fixes to the SSTII bytes tracker getting out of sync w/ the underlying stream  and did some cleanup to make the streamed/file versions less divergent.

"Todd  I briefly looked at the patch. It looks like you are trying to get rid of the Journal Spool in BN. Correct me if I am wrong. I don't think you can. BN makes a checkpoint from its memory state  which differs it from SNN and CN. While it does it  the namespace should be locked (for modifications)  so the edits go into journal spool  which is reapplied to memory after the checkpoint is finished.

"Mike: patch reads nice and clean to me (didn't try applying though)  two nits:  1) it would be good to have a test of the case where a boolean with the default boost is specified in one bq, and a seperate blank bq is specified to force the first BQ to be treated as a single query  2) let's assign  params.getParams(DMP.BQ) to a temp variable so we don't have to call it twice in three lines."	1	0

"Bertrand - nice work. This is a great idea and the patch looks good overall. Couple of points:  - Don't forget the Apache header on the new Errors class - Maybe do the grammar corrections on the counter error messages separately? Just so we keep the commits to a single issue each. - I'm not sure we need to retain the delegating ""formatValueList"" method in TestDriver. Something to discuss...  As for using Guava to do the string join - I know MRUnit used to have it as a dependency but this was removed in MRUNIT-50. Probably not worth bringing it back for such a simple method. "	1	1

"Red color isn't really important  it was just a suggestion to be more homogeneous ... but that can be revisited in a different jira. I agree an option is a good idea for automatically acknowledging hosts.  Not sure what the default should be: the current behavior is obviously to not confirm, so we could keep that one, or go for a safer one, I don't have any strong opinion on that."	0	1

"Sorry  I narrowed down the issue to Chrome's over-zealous caching. I was able to reproduce the problem on two separate computers in a simple project where I had upgraded from Wicket 1.4.0 to 1.4.15. But due to testing before and after  Chrome had cached the buggy version of wicket-ajax.js from 1.4.0 and did not detect that it changed with the update. Clearing the browser cache resolved the issue.  Sorry about the bogus bug report."	-1	-1

"Sorry it took so long to drag this up.  I think the issue I had was with the Customer => BillingInfo and Customer => ShippingInfo relationships.

I'll have to dig through the SVN history to see what I did with mandatory relationships that I mentioned being problematic in the initial bug submission."	-1	-1

"I found the reason why we observe different behaviors with the network server: Since you run with the default security manager, you actually get derby.system.home set as a system property as a side effect (see line ca line 586 in NetworkServerControl.java) as part of the set-up of the security manager. I ran without the security manager, so I did not get it set.  I do think though, that the old behavior was buggy: I can't see why one should need to set derby.system.home explicitly to get the auto-boot behavior. Unless someone can explain why this should be so, I'll file a bug for that. "	0	0

"Thanks Tucu! You are right. I had not thought of that.  I'm on the fence because we are serializing a process which should happen fast (so parallelizing is good). Like you already mentioned bq. 1* Add a method in the FileSystem to disable its shutdown hook. MRAppMaster would disable it and call closeAll() explicitly (it already does). This is already present (by setting conf.setBoolean(""fs.automatic.close"", false) ) So I'm not sure what problem this JIRA is fixing. Or are we planning for the future? I'm fine with the latter answer being yes. I'm just curious.  The patch looks good for what it intends to do, although the latest one doesn't include the fixes you made in response to Nicholas' comments."	1	1

"The issue arises due to the call to <ant> in the ""docs"" target of plugins/build.xml  It uses the system $ANT_HOME/lib/* if it can find it.  So the solution might be to add a note to howto/howto-buildPlugin.html#ant to describe the abovementioned workarounds.  Is there a better way to call forrest targets from within project ant build files. See FOR-145 ""Make Forrest able to be imported by Ant""  "	0	0

"Hmm - it seems that the patch cannot be applied on a few files - e.g. the CxfEndpoint.java patch. As it seems your patch is against an old version of the code?  e.g. your patch uses the line  {code} * @version $Revision$ {code}  when trunk is  {code} * @version $Revision: 563665 $ {code}  Any chance you could do an 'svn update' to ensure you are using the latest/greatest trunk, then create the patch again please?
