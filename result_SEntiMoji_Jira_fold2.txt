Though  pig itself compiled fine and is ready to go  the contrib projects (owl zebra piggybank/hiverc) didnt compile  I think because either it didn't download dependices of those projects or didn't include them in the build path.  Ashutosh, yes. I did realize it and as you rightly guessed, it is because the ivy-dependency list doesn't have some jars that are actually being used by contrib packages. This is not an issue related to eclipse-classpath. However, there has to be a JIRA opened to solve this issue of downloading the missing jars by ivy.  Can you please file a JIRA for this?

"> Do you think attached patch is generic?  Nothing is generic until it's used in more than one place.  The above isn't complete (it needs, e.g., 'read()' and 'seek()' implementations) but it looks like a good start.  But the real question is to you: could you use the above?  Can you present the data and checksums as input streams that support read(byte[], int, int) and seek(long)?  It also assumes a particular checksum implementation, CRC32.  If we wish to allow for others, that aspect could be generalized by adding a codec-like interface for checksummers.  But I think we should probably skip that this iteration. "	0	0

"@JMS & @stack Tks for your review and commtents, my reply as follows... bq.Have you tried it? Does it works for you? Yes, I've tested it in our env. and works well {quote} Is this required? {code} executor = null; {code} {quote} My intention was to set _executor_ explicitly if the call path is _main -> HbaseFsck -> initialPoolNumThreads -> run -> initialPoolNumThreads_, despite it should be no hurt if I remove this statement.  {quote} What JMS said (down to his +1). When you set exec = 0, it makes me wonder if it would ever be non-null and if so, should it be shutdown before you make a new one? But maybe this is an impossible state. {quote} Tks for stack's suggestion !! this way is more safer if any unexpected call happens. So I changed the code snippet into following style. How do you think about this ? {code} 288 if (executor != null) { 289      executor.shutdown(); 290      executor = null; 291 } {code}  bq.Can you do a trunk version to run hadoopqa?

"bq. Hmmm  infoStream is just for debugging... should we really make it volatile?  I'll remove its volatile...  {quote} bq. IWC cannot be made immutable – you build it up incrementally (new IWC(...).setThis(...).setThat(...)). Its fields cannot be final.  Setters can return modified immutable copy of 'this'. So you get both incremental building and immutability. {quote}  Oh yeah.  But then we'd clone the full IWC on every set... this seems like overkill in the name of ""purity"".  {quote} What about earlier compromise mentioned by Shay, Mark, me? Keep setters for 'live' properties on IW. This clearly draws the line, and you don't have to consult Javadocs for each and every setting to know if you can change it live or not. {quote}  I really don't like that this approach would split IW configuration into two places.  Like you look at the javadocs for IWC and think that you cannot change the RAM buffer size.  IWC should be the one place you go to see which settings you can change about the IW.  That some of these settings take effect ""live"" while others do not is really an orthogonal (and I think, secondary, ie handled fine w/ jdocs) aspect/concern. "	0	0

"Hello   Sure you are right here, I didn't make myself clear enough Im sorry.  As you (and RFC959) say, when we are sending the file we should transform to NVT-ASCII but not when we are receiving the file. In this second case, i think that the expected behaviour is that the text message be written to a file with the default line separator for the platform.  The sender converts the data from an internal character representation to the standard 8-bit NVT-ASCII representation (see the Telnet specification).  The receiver will convert the data from the standard form to his own internal form.   Actually , according to the spec before a RETR ASCII operation is transformed we should be converting the charset to ASCII , for our machine could be using EBCDIC  to store files and clients are supposed to expect that files are encoded in NVT-ASCII.  So I don't know ... Any way, this has little priority for me (until someone using a non-ascii-compatible encoding complains) so we could leave this for the future. Any way I don't like ASCII mode for it breaks  the 'REST' command. My implementation only supports binary mode.     "	-1	-1

"Following the recent facets work  I think that as part of this issue we should do the following two things (in addition to what I described above):  * Make OrdinalPolicy an enum with two constants (ALL/NO_PARENTS). It's already hard to support just these two (see LUCENE-4610 and LUCENE-4600), and it's not at all clear how to support arbitrary OrdinalPoilcy-ies that users will provide. ** Rather, if one really wishes to encode only say levels 3 and below, he can extend FacetFields and provide his own CategoryListBuilder. ** For the search side, he'll need to provide whatever will work for him (I cannot even describe here what API exactly because of the complexity)  * Nuke PathPolicy. One can extend FacetFields and provide his own DrillDownStream. I'll need to check about that one, but it looks like we can get rid of it too."	0	0

"Not sure if the patch was pushed for review or not. In any case  fixing the build is pretty trivial  the changes made to ModificationStatement should just be reverted (and we should just pass the CL in argument to executeWithCondition() to SP.cas()).  Other than that: * I believe we now refuse CL.SERIAL for the cas() method (because CL.blockfor() throw an UnsupportedOperationException for SERIAL). Maybe we can make SERIAL mean ""wait for nothing on commit, not even a local one"" (which probably amount to making CL.blockfor() return 0 for SERIAL and adding a 'if' in WriteResponseHandler ctor to signal right away if blockfor is 0). * I don't think CL.ANY will really work as for normal writes since we don't generate hints for commit. Maybe we could (generate hints) ultimately btw, but in the meantime, it might make more sense to refuse it (and thus make the default for CAS be either SERIAL if we do the preceding point or ONE). * We don't call CL.validateForWrite() when calling CAS (and we shouldn't as it complains with SERIAL), but maybe we should add a validateForConditionalWrite that would at least check we have the right replication strategy when using the multi-DC specific CLs."	0	0

"Sumeet  we did it purposely because if the proxy services are dynamically loaded then we need to build those services at the runtime and redeploy them which is a little bit risky on a production environment. Also there is no mechanism to check whether a particular proxy definition is updated in the registry or not because this configuration is used only at the startup.  We can add this functionality to load the proxy services only at the startup time from the registry (this doesn't mean they are dynamic), but I don't see any value there. If you could explain a bit about your exact requirement, I might be able to provide an alternative to this.  Thanks, Ruwan"	1	1

"Hi Michael  thank you for your answer. I thought that it would not be so easy to solve this issue. Unfortunately.  I agree with you that the main problem here is that a copy action is missing and I guess AttachStrategy.persist is the right place to add some kind of copy functionality.  I started looking into the source code of the enhanced class from the test. PersistenceCapable declares a public method to copy fields (pcCopyFields(...)). Unfortunately you can't use in AttachStrategy.persist, because the entity to persist has no statemanager at this point (an exception InvalidStateException will be the result).  My suggestion is to modify the class enhancement and remove the StateManager check in pcCopyFields (I don't see the need for this check). Afterwards you can use pcCopyFields in AttachStrategy.persist by adding something like  ... if (manager.getCopyNew()) { int[] fields = new int[meta.getFields().length]; for (int i = 0; i < fields.length; i++) fields[i] = i; newInstance.pcCopyFields(pc, fields); } ...  This solution works for my testcase.  As an alternative you can modify (or add an additional) newInstance to copy the data.  I have no real experience with OpenJPA. Perhaps there is a much better solution. "	0	1

"Noah said he’s going to fix this in his build-fauxton branch  but I’d like to explain this for posterity.  make indeed throws this error, I didn’t suggest it is a grunt.js error, but it’s the way we use Autotools. In particular, in how we use Autotools for packaging. Each file that is supposed to end up in our final apache-couchdb-x.y.z.tar.gz tarball needs to be marked as such in a Makefile.am. For Fauxton that means we maintain a list of Fauxton files in src/Makefila.am specified as `FAUXTON_FILES`:  FAUXTON_FILES = \ fauxton/app/addons/activetasks/assets/less/activetasks.less \ fauxton/app/addons/activetasks/base.js \ fauxton/app/addons/activetasks/resources.js \ …and so on  In that list, there is a line: `fauxton/app/initialize.js`, e.g. where we say that file is supposed to go into the release tarball. That file however does not exist at the time `make dist` is run, so make complains. I assume the solution is that make needs to call grunt at some point to turn fauxton/app/initialize.underscore into fauxton/app/initialize.js and I think that is what Noah is doing in his branch. I just wanted to explain, why this isn’t a make error. "	0	0

I'll investigate it later.  bq.Auditor will be a top level daemon, so it should own its create it's own LedgerManagers and ZooKeeper client.

"I've just gotten a chance to look at this.  A few things jump out immediately.  1) I have to chew over the changes to Cayenne core a bit more.  Off hand, they don't seem bad, but something feels weird about it.  2) While I can appreciate the cut working like a remove, it's a bit weird to be prompted to delete the item.  3) I can't paste an ObjEntity I just cut back to the same DataMap.  With the lack of an undo feature, the only reasonable thing for me to do is a revert the datamap.  4) I think my font changed for labels.  I'll have to verify that.  Looking at #3 again, actually, I can't seem to paste at all.  I even tried creating a new DataMap and was unable to paste the ObjEntity to that."	0	0

Jonathan - are you still in the loop on this one?  What do you think?  Given the fundamental differences in what a ""string"" is across different languages, there's unlikely to be a clean solution that suits everyone. Having a backwards-compatible compromise that works is much better than having nothing, though. "	0	0

"Thanks Dawid.  bq. Yes, this is pretty much the top-n nodes reordering that I did, albeit without any optimization of how many n to take (the hardcoded magic constants should probably be justified somehow? Or replaced by a default in FST somewhere?).  bq. Deciding how many nodes to reorder is I think hard – I failed to provide any sensible fast heuristic for that and I simply do a simulated annealing to find a local optimum.  Yeah the algo is simplistic now... and it does force caller to pick the params (though minInCountDeref=3 and maxDerefNodes=Inf are probably pretty good)... we can and should make it more sophisticated over time.  We have at least one spare bit to still use in the arc flags :)  bq. One thing I was wondering is why you decided to integrate the packer with the fst – wouldn't it be cleaner to separate packing from construction? Granted, this requires a double pass over the fst nodes and more intermediate memory but it wouldn't add any more complexity to the builder which is already, ehm, a bit complex . You can compare this design in Morfologik:  Well... it's tricky.  First, I decided to change node targets to ords so that pack could use an array to (relatively!) efficiently hold node data, eg inCount, newAddress, etc.  That required making the first pass FST ""modal"" (deref'd or not).  If we didn't do this then the packer would have to use even less RAM efficient data structures (eg Map<Int,X>) I think?  Second, the format written by the packer is tightly coupled with the FST reading, ie there are sizable differences when reading packed vs unpacked FST.  But I agree it'd be cleaner if we could move packing out (eg Util.pack), and more strongly decouple packing from FST format...  One thing I'd really like to somehow do is create different classes for FST writing vs reading, and different classes for each format.  We now have write-ord, write-non-ord, read-packed, read-unpacked (and even the two readers have 3 different modes depending on INPUT_TYPE).  "	1	1

"Hi Lars  sorry about the delay in responding. Good point about the TreeMap always returning result in a deterministic ordering. The patch itself I think is still beneficial because it removes a little bit of redundancy in the existing equality code. IMO, the fix makes it easier to understand as well. In addition, the tests are beneficial since we were missing coverage there.  I think it'd be better if the fix were in sooner, but it's probably not an issue if we moved it to 0.94.7."	-1	-1
