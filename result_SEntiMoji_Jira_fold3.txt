I'll keep hacking away at in in my toolbox when customer needs dictate.  Am I missing something in your approach, how would I do this then in the XML DSL using your approach?  I think virtual routing is a known limitation of Camel when you start to deploy large scale systems.

It seems normal to not be able to reproduce it consistently; I also have experienced ""dry"" runs because the buffer just happened to have been followed by an area of memory which was previously zeroed.  I tried to reproduce it on HP-UX as well but I failed. Crafting my own allocator did not help. I have spent a couple of hours on it and I am sorry I cannot spend more time to shed some more light.  All builds on all platforms with all compilers exhibit failures in the same tests in the same place. I would say this is pretty compelling evidence -- coupled with the spurious failures on selected platforms -- that there is a problem. I have my money on __rw_strtoull. :-)  Liviu"	-1	1

"Using nutch with solr has been a very demanding request  so it will be very useful when this makes into trunk. I have spend some time reviewing the patch  which I find quite elegant.  Some improvements to the patch would be - make NutchDocument implement VersionedWritable instead of writable, and delegate version checking to superclass - refactor getDetails() methods in HitDetailer to Searcher (it is not likely that a class would implement Searcher but not HitDetailer) - use Searcher, delete HitDetailer and SearchBean - Rename XXXBean classes so that they do not include ""bean"". (I think it is confusing to have bean objects that have non-trivial functionality) - refactor LuceneSearchBean.VERSION to RPCSearchBean - remove unrelated changes from the patch.(the changes in NGramProfile, HTMLLanguageParser,LanguageIdentifier,... correct me if i'm wrong)  As far as i can see, we do not need any metadata for Solr backend, and only need Store,Index and Vector options for lucene backend, so i think we can simplify NutchDocument#metadata. We may implement : {code} class FieldMeta { o.a.l.document.Field.Store store; o.a.l.document.Field.Index index; o.a.l.document.Field.TermVector tv; }  FieldMeta[] IndexingFilter.getFields();  class NutchDocument { ... private ArrayList<Field> fieldMeta; ... }  {code}  Or alternatively we may wish to keep add methods of NutchDocument compatible with o.a.l.document.Document, keeping the metadata up-to-date as we add new fields, using this info at LuceneWriter, but ignoring in SolrWriter. This will be slightly slower but the API will be much more intuitive. "	0	0

"@Owen - I'm working on getting Harmony working on Hadoop at present. We're pretty close  and have workarounds for most issues but the trick is to fix the issues in such a way that we can create a patch with a resolution that works for all the JREs.  Yes, there are equivalent classes for both IBM Java and Harmony, so we could do something whereby it identifies the JRE and then loads the appropriate library, but I'm looking to see if there is a more extensible approach.  @Nicholas - Yes, Hadoop 0.20.x works just fine on IBM Java. I've submitted patches targeted for 0.20.3 - see HADOOP-6923 and HADOOP-6924 - that makes Hadoop 0.20.x work cross JRE.  The com.sun.security.auth classes were introduced with Hadoop 0.21"	0	0
"Yes  bytes + comparator would work fine for jaql.  Preferably  it would be the same comparators that are already used by the sort code  which work on serialized bytes (but also on WritableComparables  so that might be a problem).  If these comparators are inconsistent  then the sort in map/reduce will not work properly.  I think it is ok to document the transitivity requirement  but I don't see how you can enforce it in any way.  Different key types are fine  as long as the comparator knows how to handle them.  If you can't reuse the same comparator interface  I can always implement my comparisons in another place  but I already have two of them (one in the WritableComparable  and one in the Comparator).  I don't see how column families and the key comparator are related, except that they are both table-level metadata. Yes, I agree that a single comparator would be used for the entire table. "	0	0

"So there is another thing here  by deferring the evictions to the background thread you increase the chance that the block will be tenured then it must be collected from CMS space, thus radically increasing the GC complexity of the cache.  Originally when the LRU block cache came in, it made my collections 10x as slow until I disabled the block cache for compactions.  Unfortunately all these micro-optimizations might be falling under the GC wayside.   "	0	0

I could add the same snk file to trunk and the 2.9.4 branch when I go add the build scripts to the trunk this weekend, so that all the branches are building strong assemblies.

"Hi Ivan   {quote} + long numberOfEntriesToReplicate = lastEntryId - firstEntryId; should be (lastEntryId - firstEntryId) + 1 {quote} You are right, both side entries has to be considered. Thank a lot for noticing it.  {quote} In general, I think this splitting should be in LedgerFragmentReplicator, rather than BookKeeperAdmin. This way you could avoid the need to expose the update of ledger metadata. It will make control flow a little more complex as you'll have to initiate replication on the next subfragment from the callback of the current, but i think it would encapsulate things a bit better. {quote} Yes, in general, all the split logic should be in LFR. I might pushed that code to BKAdmin because, I don't want to disturb admin key flow much, which will go through LFR. Now anyway, I moved that logic, still not disturbing BKAdmin key flows in anyway.  Attached a patch, which addresses the comments.  Also to give more confidence on split fragment scenarios, I have added multiple boundary cases for FragmentSplit.

"Some thoughts I had about this:  Overall, I think it's a good idea.  Seems like it's not crazy to add and would have multiple benefits.  Logical striping across the L1 boundary is a simple solution to both proactively handle splits and reduce compaction times.  Thoughts on this feature 1. Fixed configs : in the same way that we got a lot of stability by limiting the regions/server to a fixed number, we might want to similarly limit the number of stripes per region to 10 (or X) instead of ""every Y bytes"".  This will help us understand the benefit we get from striping and it's easy to double the striping and chart the difference. 2. NameNode pressure :  Obviously, a 10x striping factor will cause 10x scaling of the FS.  Can we offset this by increasing the HDFS block size, since addBlock dominates at scale?  Really, unlike Hadoop, you have all of the HFile or none of it.  Missing a portion of the HFile currently invalidates the whole file.  You really need 1 HDFS block == 1 HFile.  However, we could probably just toy with increasing it by the striping factor right now and seeing if that balances things. 3. Open Times : I think this will be an issue, specifically on server start.  Need to be careful here. 4. Major compaction : you can perform a major compaction (remove deletes) as long as you have [i,end) contiguous.  I don't think you'd need to involve L0 files in an MC at all.  Save the complexity.  Furthermore, part of the reason why we created the tiered compaction is to prevent small/new files from participating in MC because of cache thrashing, poor minor compactions, and a handful of other reasons.  So, some thoughts on related pain points we seem to have that tie into this feature: 1. Reduce Cache thrashing : region moves kill us a lot of time because we have a cold cache.  There is a worry that more aggressive compactions mean more thrashing.  I think it will actual even this out better since right now a MC causes a lot of churn.  Just should be thinking about this if perf after the feature isn't what we desire. 2. Unnecessary IOPS : outside of this algorithm, we should just completely get rid of the requirement to compact after a split.  We have the block cache, so given a [start,end) in the file, we can easily tell our mid point for future splits.  There's little reason to aggressively churn in this way after splitting. 3. Poor locality : for grid topology setups, we should eventually make the striping algorithm a little more intelligent about picking our replicas.  If all stripes go to the same secondary & tertiary node, then splits have a very restricted set of servers to chose for datanode locality. "	1	1

"Hi Manjula  I think your approach basically looks good. Please see my comments below.  1) I think this code  +        NetworkServerControl serverControl = null; +        int port = TestConfiguration.getCurrent().getPort(); +        String hostName = TestConfiguration.getCurrent().getHostName(); +        serverControl = new NetworkServerControl(InetAddress +                .getByName(hostName), port);// initialized for the shutdown.  could be replaced by a call to NetworkServerTestSetup.getNetworkServerControl()  2) +        try { +            serverControl.shutdown(); +        } catch (Exception e) { +            fail(""Unexpected exception"" + e.getMessage()); +            e.printStackTrace(); +        }  e.printStackTrace() won't ever be called, since it's placed right after a call to fail(). Anyway, I think it is better just to remove the try/catch/fail and let JUnit handle the exception itself.  3) I can't see that getNewPort() is used, so it's probably best to remove it.  4) It looks like most of the changes in TestConfiguration.java are reformatting/white-space changes. If you could post a new patch which only contained what's actually changed, it would be easier to review those changes."	0	1

Thanks again,  Jim Mason   https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/JSPWIKI-24?page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:all-tabpanel ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   __________________________________________________ Do You Yahoo!?

"Truth is that  the sheer size of CFStore (over 2K line) annoys me. I think this prove CFStore has too much things in it and we messed up at encapsulation. So I tried to make DataTracker be about dealing with the memtables and sstables as much as possible. And being able to have View not leak from DataTracker sound like a proof that we do have some encapsulation there. I'm not claiming it's perfect  but I really don't think that CFStore is our most beautiful class in there and I do believe that DataTracker improves this a bit.  But there is a good part of subjectivity in all this anyway. And if people really don't like the move of the bits of querying in there, fine, I'd move them back in CFStore and leak the View from DataTracker. I would however be more reluctant to remove DataTracker altogether and put the AtomicReference in CFStore. Because this would move all the CAS related logic in CFStore and seriously there is already too much stuff in CFStore. My humble opinion though. "	0	0
