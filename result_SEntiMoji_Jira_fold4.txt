"Well  since you didn't respond to my request I finally did without and checked out what you did.  First of all looking at CIncludeTransformer I have to say that I don't understand why it is doing its own caching. Caching should be the concern of pipelines and sources. If you want preemptive loading of cached content this would much better be implemented as a Source wrapper. In fact we now have such a class in the scratchpad area.  One unpleasant implication of the current design is that as an unsuspecting user of this class, when you turn on caching in this transformer, the cached contents of any included cocoon:// source that identifies a caching pipeline would be cached twice! Once by the pipeline itself and once by the CIncludeTransformer.  Now concerning your patch. I don't quite understand why you retain the validity of the cached contents. The algorithm the caching pipeline uses to determine the validity of the cached contents is as follows: first it looks at the validity of the cached pipeline contents itself, then if the validity by itself indicates it needs a current validity to check against then the pipeline contructs a pipeline validity by calling the participating components' getValidity() methods. If your component now returns the same validity object that you previously returned then that does not make much sense to me.  Since I really needed this functionality myself and I didn't have enough time to discuss and refactor the CIncludeTransformer I implemented my own very basic IncludeTransformer that does exactly what I need, no more no less. I'll post it here if anyone want to use it.  I also looked at the XIncludeTransformer to see if I could implement caching in that one instead. But it seems that the XIncludeTransformer reads included content from URL objects instead of from Source objects."	0	0

"bq. Actually  DIH started as a standalone webapp inside AOL. We changed it because we didn't want to duplicate the schema in two places and also because we wanted to have it available by default in Solr installations.  Another web app means you need to procure hardware  plan capacity/failover  create firewall holes etc  Even if it were a standalone app, I would still run it on the same hardware that runs Solr, though I might run it on the secondary servers that aren't normally seeing query load.  Why would you need to have the schema in two places?  My DIH config doesn't mention any field names, because all Solr field names match the MySQL field names.  Even if they didn't, I'm not sure why it would be any different than any other SolrJ client, which doesn't need to have a copy of the schema.  bq. Talking to multiple collections was never a goal for DIH – I'm not sure what value it will bring.  I've got a sharded index; currently production is on version 3.5.0.  Full rebuilds are done with DIH because my SolrJ application can't touch it for indexing speed.  It does fine for keeping the index up to date with once-a-minute updates, but for indexing millions of documents per shard, DIH beats it handily even though it's only single-threaded.  If I could put all the DIH stuff into one central place, it might make it easier to manage.  I do intend to look at the DIH code to see how it manages to run so fast, so I can hopefully improve my own code, but I can never find the time. "	0	0

"John: first off  i want to apologize for the *extremely* belated patch review ... I know i told you i'd try to look at this months ago  but ... yeah ... life tends to get in the way of patches.  on the whole, things seem pretty good -- although you were still using an interface instead of an abstract class.  Having the main API for a type of plugin be an abstract class is an important mechanism to help future proof ourselves against possible additions we want to make the the plugin API in the future; if it's an interface we can't really change it once it's released (because we might break people Impls); if it's an abstract class, we can always provide a default impl for people.  the biggest concern i have about this patch at the moment is that there are no tests, and no example configs, so it's hard to be sure it's even working at all :)  here's what i see as the current todo list for this issue...  1) there are some legacy SolrIndexSearcher constructors that need to delegate to the SolrCore to get indexReaderFactory ... perhaps we should have a helper method that decides which SolrIndexConfig to use based on the ""name"" ? 2) we need tests showing custom IndexReaderFactory getting used (even if it's just a mock IndexReaderFactory thatsets a boolean to show it's being used) ... this will also serve as a test that config syntax works. 3) need commented out example of using a custom indexReaderFactory in example/solr/conf/solrconfig.xml 4) sanity check this against SOLR-465, make sure we aren't painting ourselves into a corner. 5) we should make IndexReaderFactory use the AbstractPluginLoader stuff and remove the guts of SolrIndexConfig.loadIndexReaderFactory.  It looks like we'll need to add a ""single item"" version of load to the AbstractPluginLoader to make that work well.  #5 is something that can be done after this is committed, but 1-4 are pretty important.  If you can update the patch with some configs/tests i'll think about the legacy SolrIndexSearcher constructors and try to figure out a good solution for them "	0	1

"1. My feeling is that ""if (file.lastModified() < now + ACCESS_TIME_RESOLUTION)"" is not necessary  since the lastModified value will already be truncated to the system resolution  but I do not think it is harmful.  2. I chose to throw exception only if file.canWrite, because I was trying to minimise the impact of the change. It's not clear to me whether setLastModified might work when !file.canWrite. However, it certainly must work (because of GC) if file.canWrite. I would consider moving the canWrite test outside of the setLastModified call, similar to getRecordIfStored, it just wasn't necessary to fix the immediate problem.  3. Well, not swallowed exactly, but caught and converted to failure return code (-1) e.g. see BLOBInDataStore.getSize. In any case, the javadoc for Property.getLength/getLengths documents -1 as a possible ""failure"" return code, so it had to be tested. I think if Property.getLength/getLengths throws an exception, that is already correctly handled.  Thanks for the quick response.  "	0	1

"{quote} I don't think it makes sense to argue about who the exception messages are for [...] {quote}  I think the opposite, because it has an impact on the library design. Not that CM cannot go on with the current way; but my point is that Luc and you are focusing on top-level users while stressing that CM in a low-level component. To me, that is a blatant contradiction that produces drawbacks which I presented in several usage examples (which you didn't address), while you always reply with a single use case where the user is yourself (i.e. a CM developer). Anyone else who is using a high-level application based on CM will be baffled by the ""detailed exception message"" because, in all but the most trivial case, his actions will have only a remote connection to the exception triggered by CM. I'm pinpointing at a minute detail of the design of CM, explaining that it can come in the way of some direct users of CM. The current long list of errors is in fact imposing your view (of what is important) to future application developers. [As an example, let's say that someone wants to create a GUI (e.g. for the statistician referred to above), he will want to define his own detailed error messages to be displayed in the GUI with a formatting of his choice. The statistician will never see the messages created by CM.] If a CM exception (resulting from a precondition violation) reaches the end-user level, it means there was some unanticipated problem in the call chain. And to correct it, one would need more than just the ""detailed message"": the end-user will pass the stack trace to the application developer, who will correct a possible bug in his code (such as a missing check of a precondition) or pass it on the the CM developers.

"I apologize for taking so long to get to reviewing this.  This has some good elements but also quite a few problems.  Here are a few suggestions.  1. The bindingGBeans do not need to know the name of the gbean they are getting something to bind into jndi from, they need a reference to it.  Similarly they do not need to bind a naming Reference, they can bind the object itself.  For instance, the connector binding gbean can do something like this:  private final ManagedConnectionFactoryWrapper managedConnectionFactoryWrapper; // this is the reference to the gbean that gives us the connection factory to bind  ...  //now it's time to bind the connection factory  Object connectionFactory = managedConnectionFactoryWrapper.$getResource(); globalContext.bind(jndiName, connectionFactory);  This is also going to affect how the builders set up the binding gbeans: they know the name of the appropriate gbean such as managedConnectionFactoryWrapper, since they just created it, so they need to use that name to set the reference pattern in the binding gbean.  The binding gbean will then get (a proxy to) the ""real"" gbean that it can use as outlined above.  2. I don't see an implementation of a writable thread safe jndi Context, as dain pointed out you would need.  3. The zip file consists almost entirely of irrelevant files and the actual source files do not all appear to be in the geronimo project structure.  This makes it extremely hard to figure out what to look at.  4. Some of the code modifications (such as to ServiceConfigBuilder) appear to be test cases rather than production code.  It will be a lot easier to evaluate your work if you keep test cases and production code clearly separated as is done in typical maven projects.  5. I think you will need to redo the openejb work after dain's reintegration of his container rewrite.  Thanks!  Let us know if you have any questions about this."	0	1

"I just glanced through in general: this is similar to the hack patch i used exploring LUCENE-4089  though I just used a Map<String String>.  The part i didnt like when exploring was more related to how term index/term dictionary are separated: {quote} divisor: generalize this into something simple like a Map<String,String> of codec ""parameters"" that you set on IWC/IR. split divisor from ""don't load terms index"". define these as constants where they belong. I got unhappy here in the ""splitting"" part because I wanted the divisor part in TermsIndexReaderBase, but that doesnt extend FieldsProducer (where i wanted the ""don't load"" part) and wrap the terms dict, instead its backwards and terms dict wraps the TermsIndexReaderBase... maybe we should fix that too? I think this confusing the way it is but I didnt look at how difficult this would be. {quote}  But I think maybe I was trying to tackle too much at once... still as an ""untyped"" parameter I thought it would be useful to fix the semantics all in one break rather than causing confusion down the road.

"Hi Thiwanka   I assume you're referring to this code which checks the character offset and produces progress events if the XMLLocator has advanced at least 2K:  public void startElement (QName element, XMLAttributes attributes, Augmentations augs) throws XNIException { if(locator.getCharacterOffset() == 0) { reportProgressEvents(); nextCharOffset += 2048; }else if(locator.getCharacterOffset() > nextCharOffset) { reportProgressEvents(); nextCharOffset += 2048; }  //Call the AbstractDOMParser.startElement() super.startElement(element, attributes, augs); }  That looks fine to me.  Just mentioned this to Ishara... In future it would be easier to review changes if you created a patch (e.g. diff -u) which shows the differences between the previous version. Generally also better to add source files as an attachment to the JIRA issue rather than including it directly as a comment. This makes it easier to review and apply to the codebase.  Thanks. "	0	1
